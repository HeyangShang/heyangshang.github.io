I am Heyang Shang, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

I am interested in the intersection of computer science and economics.
